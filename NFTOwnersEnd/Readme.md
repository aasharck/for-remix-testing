## Nft Owners end

This folder contains 2 files. the nft contract and the import soldidty file. These two need not be deployed by the deployer.
This is just to demonstrate how this would work

So the nft contract owner would need to include an import to make it compatible with this protocol.

### Suggestion to improve:
This import could be hosted on Github and NPM like how openzeppelin does. For egs: To import Openzeppelin Ownable Contract we install openzeppelin contracts with npm and then import the module. We could do the same with this import file too.
